### Code for Graph Smoothing using Random Spanning Forests
The Julia code for graph smoothing using RSFs is available [here](codes/smoothingRSF.zip). This code re-produces the figures in [the conference paper](papers/smoothingRSF.pdf). The main author is [Nicolas Tremblay](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/~nicolas.tremblay/index.php).

### Code for Graph Tikhonov regularization and Interpolation using Random Spanning Forests
The Julia code for graph Tikhonov regularization and Interpolation using RSFs is available [here](codes/rsf_journal_codes.zip). This code re-produces the figures in [the submitted paper](papers/rsf_ieee_jrnl.pdf).
