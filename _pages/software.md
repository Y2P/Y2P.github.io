### Code for Graph Smoothing using Random Spanning Forests
The Julia code for graph smoothing using RSFs is available [here](/files/codes/smoothingRSF.zip). This code reproduces the results in [the conference paper](papers/smoothingRSF.pdf). The main author is [Nicolas Tremblay](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/~nicolas.tremblay/index.php).
